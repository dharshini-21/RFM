Goal:
----
To categorize customers based on their buying behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
----------------------
Step 1: Filter Orders by Date
Limit data to purchases made between June 1 and December 30, 2023.

Step 2: Calculate Total Spend
For each customer, we calculate the total spend by each user.

Step 3:Segmenting user spend into four categories for monetary.
Tier 1 -->total_amount >900 
Tier 2 -->total_amount between 600 and 900 
Tier 3 -->total_amount between 300 and 600 
Tier 4 -->total_amount between 0 and 300 

Step 4:Count of Orders placed by each user for given time period
Tier 1 -->count_of_orders > 6
Tier 2 -->count_of_orders between 4 and 6 
Tier 3 -->count_of_orders between 2 and 4 
Tier 4 -->between 0 and 2 

Step 5:Segmenting user order count into four categories for frequency

Step 6:Duration between last order purchase date till date
Tier 1 -->days between 0 and 55 
Tier 2 -->days between 55 and 110 
Tier 3 -->days between 110 and 165 
Tier 4 -->days > 165 

Step 7:Segmenting days difference into four categories for Recency
Step 8:Grouping customer categories based on recency,monetary,frequency
Customers are segregated based on the above RFM Tiers
●Best Customers – This group consists of those customers who are found in R-Tier-1, F-Tier-1 and M-Tier-1, meaning that they transacted recently, do so often and spend more than other customers. A shorthand notation for this segment is 1-1-1; we’ll use this notation going forward.

●High-spending New Customers – This group consists of those customers in 1-4-1 and 1-4-2. These are customers who transacted only once, but very recently and they spent a lot.

●Lowest-Spending Active Loyal Customers – This group consists of those customers in segments 1-1-3 and 1-1-4 (they transacted recently and do so often, but spend the least).

●Churned Best Customers – This segment consists of those customers in groups 4-1-1, 4-1-2, 4-2-1 and 4-2-2 (they transacted frequently and spent a lot, but it’s been a long time since they’ve transacted).

Step 9:To neglect null values and get customer details to give specific offers

Step 10: To get user details and send them customized offers to enhance customer satisfaction and retain them
